###Config
The 10 is delay in seconds before posting. You can have multiple channels at the same time. Do different delays, so you dont get ratelimited.
let channels = [['CHANNELID', 'TEXT YOU WANT TO ADVERTISE', 10], ['CHANNELID', 'TEXT YOU WANT TO ADVERTISE', 15]]

Here is a config that will send messages in 3 channels
[['342342342345', 'Buy this!', 10], ['4902384092357', 'Buy this too!', 15], ['384732849235', 'buy this item', '20']]
